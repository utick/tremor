### A quake-style drop-down browser you can open from anywhere

## FAQ

### Why?

TL;DR: Because I wanted one and couldn't find one.

Quite often when you're working/programming/gaming you want to quickly google something. The flow tends to be: alt-tab to browser, cmd+t to open new tab, google thing, alt tab back to main task. An hour or two later you have like 40 tabs open for garbage you don't need anymore.

With Tremor, you can quickly pull up a browser tab, do your task and then have the browser close sight unseen with a single hotkey.

### How?

Head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/zbarbuto/tremor/releases) and download the latest.

Launch the app then `` CTRL+ALT+` `` to summon browser. Note, it opens on the monitor your cursor is on.

**Note** You will likely have to trust un-trusted developers when launching as I haven't setup signing/notarizing for it yet.

### Can it use my normal chrome profile?

Probably but I don't know how yet

### Can it open an address bar instead of google search by default?

Yes, I'll do it later. I made this in 30 minutes so didn't really put much thought into features.

### "Tremor"?

Quake -> Earthquake -> Tremors.... I dunno, you name it!
