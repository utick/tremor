  ### A quake-style drop-down browser you can open from anywhere
  
  ## FAQ
  
  ### Why?
  
  Because I wanted one and couldn't find one
  
  ### How?
  
  Launch the app ``then CTRL+ALT+` `` to summon browser. Note, it opens on the monitor your cursor is on.
  
  ### Can it use my normal chrome profile?
  
  Probably but I don't know how yet
  
  ### Can it open an address bar instead of google search by default?
  
  Yes, I'll do it later. I made this in 30 minutes so didn't really put much thought into features.
  
  ### "Tremor"?
  
  Quake -> Earthquake -> Tremors.... I dunno, you name it!
